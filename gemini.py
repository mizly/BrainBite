print(brainrotOutput("One might counter, of course, that a theory based on only a single\
 case is inherently problematic and that, moreover,20 German political\
 development during this period was certainly influenced by a range of\
 factors extending beyond civil society, many of them highly particular.\
 Nevertheless, there are several reasons why an inability of neo\
 Tocquevillean analysis to account for the central features of this case\
 should be significant and troubling. First, scholars have long viewed\
 the Weimar Republic and its collapse as a crucial theoretical testing\
 ground. The disintegration of democracy in interwar Germany is so\
 central to our understanding of comparative politics and so critical for\
 the history of modern Europe that we should at the least be wary of any\
 theory of political development that cannot explain it"))
